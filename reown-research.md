## Quick Integration Guide

### 1. Install

```

### 2. Configure Merchant Wallet
```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_MERCHANT_WALLET=0xYourWalletAddress
```

### 3. Basic Payment
```javascript
import { pay } from '@reown/appkit-pay'

// Process a payment - goes directly to your wallet!
const result = await pay({
    recipient: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MERCHANT_WALLET,
    amount: 29.99, // USD amount
    paymentAsset: USDC_BASE // USDC on Base network
})
```

### 4. Payment Assets (Base Network)
```javascript
const USDC_BASE = {
    network: 'eip155:8453', // Base Mainnet
    asset: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913',
    metadata: { name: 'USD Coin', symbol: 'USDC', decimals: 6 }
}
```
