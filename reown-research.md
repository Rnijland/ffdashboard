# Reown AppKit Payment Integration Research

## Executive Summary

After researching the Reown AppKit documentation, I've discovered that **Reown AppKit is NOT just for onramp** - it's a complete payment processing solution for Web3 applications. However, the documentation reveals a critical distinction:

1. **AppKit Core** - Wallet connections, onramp, swaps (what we implemented)
2. **AppKit Pay** - Merchant payment processing for products/services (what we actually need)

## Critical Finding: AppKit Pay vs AppKit

### What We Implemented (AppKit Core)
- Basic wallet connection
- Onramp via Meld.io (buying crypto)
- User-focused features

### What We Actually Need (AppKit Pay)
**AppKit Pay** is a separate module designed specifically for merchants to:
- Accept payments for products/services
- Configure merchant receiving wallets
- Handle subscriptions and recurring payments
- Process payments from both wallets AND exchanges

## AppKit Pay Features

### Payment Methods
1. **Pay with Self-Custodial Wallet** - MetaMask, Trust, Ledger, etc.
2. **Pay with Exchange** - Direct from Binance, Coinbase (no withdrawals needed!)
3. **One-Click Checkout** - Fast, mobile-optimized flows (coming soon)
4. **Subscriptions & Recurring Payments** - For memberships, SaaS (coming soon)

### Key Benefits for FanFlow
- **600+ wallet support** - Maximum user reach
- **Exchange payments** - Users can pay directly from CEX accounts
- **Multi-chain** - EVM, Solana, Bitcoin support
- **No smart contract deployment needed** - AppKit handles the infrastructure

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Install AppKit Pay Module
```bash
npm install @reown/appkit-pay
```

### 2. Basic Payment Configuration
```javascript
import { pay, baseSepoliaETH } from '@reown/appkit-pay'

// Process a payment
const result = await pay({
    recipient: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_WALLET_ADDRESS', // <-- This is where we set the receiving wallet!
    amount: 0.001, // Amount in ETH/USDC
    paymentAsset: baseSepoliaETH // or USDC on Base
})
```

### 3. Custom Asset Configuration (for USDC on Base)
```javascript
const USDC_BASE = {
    network: 'eip155:8453', // Base Mainnet
    asset: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC contract
    metadata: {
        name: 'USD Coin',
        symbol: 'USDC',
        decimals: 6
    }
}
```

### 4. Available Functions
- `pay()` - Opens payment modal with merchant configuration
- `getExchanges()` - Get available exchanges for payment
- `getPayResult()` - Retrieve payment result
- `getPayError()` - Get payment errors
- `getIsPaymentInProgress()` - Check payment status

## What's Missing from Documentation

The documentation doesn't clearly explain:
1. **How to integrate with existing subscription logic** - We need to trigger `pay()` when users select subscription packages
2. **Webhook configuration** - How to verify payments server-side
3. **Smart contract interaction** - If we need custom logic beyond simple transfers
4. **Fee structure** - Who pays gas, platform fees, etc.

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Replace Thirdweb CheckoutWidget with AppKit Pay
1. Install `@reown/appkit-pay`
2. Configure merchant wallet address (environment variable)
3. Replace CheckoutWidget in payment components with AppKit Pay
4. Test with Base Sepolia USDC

### Phase 2: Integrate Subscription Logic
1. Modify `subscription-payment-widget.tsx` to use AppKit Pay
2. Pass agency/creator metadata through payment
3. Handle payment success/failure callbacks
4. Update database with payment info

### Phase 3: Add Exchange Payments
1. Enable "Pay with Exchange" option
2. Test Binance/Coinbase direct payments
3. Verify funds arrive in merchant wallet

### Phase 4: Production Setup
1. Switch to Base mainnet
2. Configure production merchant wallet
3. Set up monitoring and analytics
4. Test with real payments

## Key Differences from Thirdweb

| Feature | Thirdweb | Reown AppKit Pay |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| Onramp | ✅ Coinbase | ✅ Meld.io (9 providers) |
| Wallet Payments | ✅ | ✅ 600+ wallets |
| Exchange Payments | ❌ | ✅ Binance, Coinbase |
| Subscriptions | ❌ Manual | ✅ Native (coming) |
| Smart Contracts | Required | Optional |
| Integration Time | Days | Hours |

## Critical Questions to Answer

1. **Merchant Wallet**: Where should payments go? (Need environment variable)
2. **Payment Verification**: How to verify on backend? (Webhooks vs on-chain)
3. **Fee Distribution**: How to split between agency/creator/platform?
4. **Refunds**: How to handle refunds/disputes?

## Next Steps

1. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MERCHANT_WALLET=0x... # Your receiving wallet
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_NETWORK=eip155:8453 # Base mainnet
   ```

2. **Install AppKit Pay**
   ```bash
   npm install @reown/appkit-pay
   ```

3. **Create Payment Service**
   - `/src/lib/payment/appkit-pay.ts`
   - Configure merchant wallet
   - Set up payment assets (ETH/USDC)
   - Handle success/error callbacks

4. **Update Payment Widgets**
   - Replace Thirdweb CheckoutWidget
   - Use AppKit Pay `pay()` function
   - Pass merchant configuration

## Conclusion

We implemented the wrong part of AppKit. We need **AppKit Pay** for merchant payments, not just the basic AppKit for wallet connections and onramp. The good news is that AppKit Pay is specifically designed for our use case - accepting payments for subscriptions and services with a configured merchant wallet.

The implementation is actually simpler than Thirdweb because:
1. No smart contract deployment needed
2. Built-in exchange payment support
3. Native subscription support (coming soon)
4. Better documentation and examples

**Recommendation**: Implement AppKit Pay to replace Thirdweb CheckoutWidget for all payment processing, keeping Meld.io onramp as a bonus feature for users who need to buy crypto first.
